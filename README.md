- 📷 **Captures Intruder’s Image** using the webcam  
- 📩 **Sends Email Alerts** with the intruder's photo  
- 📲 **Sends SMS Notifications** via Twilio  
- ⚡ **Fast Response** – triggers immediately upon detection  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- Twilio API (`twilio`)  
- Windows Management Instrumentation (`wmi`)  

## 🚀 Installation  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intruder-detection.git
   cd intruder-detection
   ```
2️⃣ Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python smtplib wmi twilio
```
3️⃣ Configure your credentials in the script (EMAIL_SENDER, TWILIO_SID, etc.).
